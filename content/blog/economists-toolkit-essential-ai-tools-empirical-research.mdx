Empirical economics has never been more data-intensive. Panel datasets span decades and millions of observations. Natural experiments require merging administrative records across agencies. Field experiments generate real-time behavioral data at scale. The tools researchers use to collect, process, analyze, and publish this data determine not just efficiency but research quality.

Yet many economics departments still rely on workflows designed for a previous era -- manual data cleaning scripts passed between research assistants, Stata do-files with hundreds of lines of undocumented transformations, and LaTeX manuscripts emailed between coauthors in version-named files.

AI is reshaping every stage of this pipeline. This guide maps the landscape of AI-powered tools available to empirical economists in 2026, organized by research phase, with honest assessments of what works, what remains immature, and where the highest returns lie.

## The Empirical Research Pipeline

Before evaluating tools, it helps to see the full pipeline clearly:

<StepGuide>
  <Step number={1} title="Data Collection">Acquiring raw data from surveys, APIs, web sources, administrative records, and experimental platforms.</Step>
  <Step number={2} title="Data Processing">Cleaning, merging, reshaping, and constructing variables from raw inputs into analysis-ready datasets.</Step>
  <Step number={3} title="Analysis">Running regressions, estimating structural models, conducting inference, and producing tables and figures.</Step>
  <Step number={4} title="Writing">Drafting papers, formatting for journal submission, managing references, and iterating through revisions.</Step>
  <Step number={5} title="Experiment Platforms">Designing and deploying behavioral experiments, surveys, and field interventions.</Step>
</StepGuide>

Each stage has distinct technical demands. The AI tools that matter are those that address real bottlenecks rather than adding complexity for its own sake.

## Category 1: Data Collection

### The Bottleneck

Economists spend enormous time acquiring data. Web scraping government portals, negotiating API access, designing and fielding surveys, and cleaning administrative records are all labor-intensive tasks that precede any actual analysis.

### AI-Powered Tools

| Tool Category | Traditional Approach | AI-Powered Approach | Time Savings |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Web scraping | Custom Python/R scripts per source | AI agents that adapt to site structure changes | 60-80% |
| API integration | Manual documentation reading, custom wrappers | Natural language API query construction | 40-60% |
| Survey design | Manual Qualtrics/SurveyMonkey construction | AI-assisted question generation with bias checking | 30-50% |
| Administrative data | Manual FOI requests, format negotiation | Automated format detection and schema mapping | 50-70% |

**Web scraping and data extraction.** Traditional scraping breaks whenever a website updates its structure. AI-powered scrapers use language models to understand page semantics rather than relying on brittle CSS selectors. When a government statistics portal redesigns its layout, an AI scraper adapts without code changes. Tools in this space now support structured data extraction from PDFs, scanned documents, and even images of tables.

**Survey instruments.** AI survey assistants can draft question batteries, check for leading language, suggest attention check items, and generate translations. The real value is not in replacing the researcher's judgment about what to measure but in accelerating the mechanical work of constructing clean, well-formatted instruments.

<Callout type="info" title="Data Quality Starts at Collection">
No amount of downstream processing fixes poorly collected data. AI tools that improve collection quality -- better survey instruments, more robust scraping, automated validation at intake -- deliver compounding returns throughout the research pipeline.
</Callout>

**API access and integration.** Modern AI coding assistants can read API documentation and generate working client code in minutes. For economists who regularly pull data from FRED, World Bank, Census Bureau, or Eurostat APIs, this eliminates hours of boilerplate work per project.

## Category 2: Data Processing

### The Bottleneck

[Data processing](/blog/hidden-cost-manual-data-processing-academic-research) is where most research assistant hours are spent. Merging datasets with inconsistent identifiers, handling missing values, constructing panel structures, recoding variables, and building [replication-ready datasets](/blog/building-replication-packages-with-ai) are tasks that are tedious, error-prone, and poorly documented.

<MetricGrid>
  <Metric value="40-60%" label="Of RA time spent on data cleaning" source="NBER RA Survey 2025" />
  <Metric value="3-5x" label="More time cleaning than analyzing" />
  <Metric value="70%" label="Of replication failures trace to data processing errors" source="I4R Report 2025" />
  <Metric value="$25-45/hr" label="Typical RA cost for manual data work" />
</MetricGrid>

### AI-Powered Tools

| Task | Traditional Method | AI Method | Key Advantage |
|------|-------------------|-----------|---------------|
| Data cleaning | Manual Stata/R scripts | AI agents that detect anomalies and suggest fixes | Catches patterns humans miss |
| Merging datasets | Hand-coded join logic | Fuzzy matching with AI entity resolution | Handles inconsistent identifiers |
| Panel construction | Custom reshaping code | Schema-aware restructuring | Preserves temporal relationships |
| Variable construction | Manual recoding | Natural language variable definitions | Self-documenting transformations |
| Documentation | After-the-fact codebooks | Auto-generated data dictionaries | Always synchronized with data |

**Automated data cleaning.** AI cleaning agents can profile a dataset, identify outliers, flag inconsistencies, detect encoding issues, and suggest transformations -- all before the researcher writes a single line of code. The best implementations generate Stata or R code that the researcher can review, modify, and include in replication packages.

This is the core capability of Maestro's [RA Data](https://ra.maestro.onl) service: transforming messy public data sources into paper-ready datasets through automated cleaning, merging, and visualization pipelines. The service supports Stata, R, and Python, handles complex merges across heterogeneous sources, and produces fully documented replication packages.

**Entity resolution and fuzzy matching.** Merging firm-level data across Compustat, CRSP, and patent databases requires matching on names that are formatted differently across sources. AI entity resolution systems now achieve match rates above 95% on standard benchmarks, compared to 60-75% for traditional string-matching approaches.

**Panel data construction.** Building balanced or unbalanced panels from repeated cross-sections involves careful handling of entry, exit, and missing periods. AI agents can infer the panel structure from data characteristics and generate appropriate reshaping code with built-in consistency checks.

<Callout type="warning" title="Trust but Verify">
AI data processing tools accelerate the work, but the researcher remains responsible for every transformation. Always review generated code, spot-check outputs against known values, and maintain a clear audit trail. Automated does not mean unreviewed.
</Callout>

## Category 3: Analysis

### The Bottleneck

Statistical analysis in economics requires both technical fluency with econometric methods and deep domain knowledge about when each method is appropriate. The mechanical work -- running regressions, formatting output tables, producing figures, conducting robustness checks -- is time-consuming but largely predictable.

### AI-Powered Tools

| Tool Type | What It Does | Maturity Level |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Stata/R/Python AI copilots | Autocomplete code, suggest specifications | High |
| Automated regression output | Generate formatted tables from model objects | High |
| Robustness check generators | Systematically vary specifications | Medium |
| Causal inference assistants | Suggest identification strategies, check assumptions | Medium |
| Power analysis tools | Calculate sample requirements with simulation | High |
| Visualization generators | Produce publication-ready figures from natural language | Medium-High |

**AI copilots for statistical languages.** The most immediately useful category. Modern AI copilots understand Stata syntax, R tidyverse conventions, and Python's statsmodels/linearmodels ecosystem. They can generate regression specifications from natural language descriptions, suggest appropriate standard error clustering, and format output for journal submission.

For a researcher estimating a difference-in-differences model, an AI copilot can generate the full specification including parallel trends tests, event study plots, and robustness to alternative control groups -- tasks that might take hours of manual coding compressed into minutes of review and refinement.

**Automated table and figure generation.** Tools like `esttab`, `stargazer`, and `modelsummary` have long automated table formatting. AI adds a layer of intelligence: suggesting which models to present side by side, flagging inconsistencies across specifications, and generating figures that meet specific journal style requirements.

**Robustness and sensitivity analysis.** AI agents can systematically explore the specification space -- varying control sets, functional forms, sample restrictions, and estimation methods -- and present results as specification curves. This addresses concerns about researcher degrees of freedom by making the full set of reasonable specifications transparent.

<KeyTakeaway title="Analysis Is Where AI Copilots Deliver the Fastest ROI">
Economists already know what analysis they want to run. The bottleneck is translating intent into correct code across idiosyncratic statistical software. AI copilots directly address this translation gap, making them the highest-value AI investment for most researchers.
</KeyTakeaway>

## Category 4: Writing and Publication

### The Bottleneck

Academic writing in economics involves LaTeX formatting, reference management, coauthor coordination, and multiple revision cycles. A typical paper goes through 15-30 drafts between initial manuscript and publication. Each revision cycle involves reformatting, updating references, regenerating tables, and copy-editing.

### AI-Powered Tools

| Tool Type | Function | AI Advantage |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| LaTeX editors with AI | Real-time compilation, error detection | Catches formatting issues instantly |
| AI proofreaders | Grammar, style, and clarity checking | Discipline-specific language conventions |
| Reference managers | Citation organization and formatting | Auto-extraction from PDFs, deduplication |
| Coauthor coordination | Version control, comment resolution | Merge conflict detection, change summarization |
| Methods section drafters | Generate technical writing from code/output | Consistent notation, complete specification reporting |

**Collaborative LaTeX environments.** Modern LaTeX platforms combine real-time compilation with AI-assisted editing. Maestro's [RA Paper](https://ra.maestro.onl) provides collaborative LaTeX editing with real-time compilation, Git integration for version control, AI proofreading, and journal-ready templates for AER, QJE, Econometrica, and other top outlets. The AI proofreader understands economics-specific conventions -- when to use "significant" versus "statistically significant," how to report standard errors, and formatting norms for different journals.

**AI writing assistants for technical prose.** The most productive use of AI in academic writing is not generating text wholesale but improving existing drafts. AI can identify unclear passages, suggest more precise terminology, flag inconsistencies between the text and tables, and ensure that all variables mentioned in the text are defined.

**Reference management with AI.** AI-powered reference tools can extract citation information from PDFs, resolve DOIs, detect duplicate entries, and format bibliographies for specific journals. When a referee asks you to add 15 citations on a related topic, AI can suggest relevant papers from your existing library and recent publications.

<Callout type="info" title="Writing Quality Compounds">
Small improvements in writing clarity, table formatting, and reference accuracy reduce reviewer complaints and revision cycles. AI writing tools pay for themselves by shortening the submission-to-publication timeline.
</Callout>

## Category 5: Experiment Platforms

### The Bottleneck

Behavioral and experimental economists need to deploy interactive experiments to participants. Traditional approaches require either learning web development (JavaScript, HTML, CSS) or using constrained platforms like oTree or z-Tree that impose rigid design patterns.

### AI-Powered Tools

| Platform Type | Traditional | AI-Powered | Key Difference |
|--------------|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| Game theory experiments | oTree (Python required) | Natural language to experiment | No coding needed |
| Survey experiments | Qualtrics (point-and-click) | AI-generated adaptive surveys | Dynamic branching logic |
| Field experiments | Custom app development | AI-generated participant interfaces | Weeks to hours |
| Auction mechanisms | z-Tree (proprietary language) | Describe mechanism, get implementation | Accessible to non-programmers |

Maestro's [Econ](https://econ.maestro.onl) platform represents the frontier of this category. Researchers describe experiments in natural language -- specifying game structure, conditions, randomization, and outcome measures -- and receive fully functional, participant-ready web applications. A dictator game with three treatment conditions and embedded comprehension checks that would take a research assistant two weeks to implement in oTree can be generated in an afternoon.

**Adaptive experiment design.** AI-powered platforms can modify experiment parameters based on incoming data -- adjusting difficulty, rebalancing conditions, or extending data collection for underpowered cells. This is particularly valuable for field experiments where recruitment is expensive and fixed sample sizes may prove insufficient.

**Integrated data collection and analysis.** When the experiment platform and analysis tools share a common AI backbone, the pipeline from data collection to preliminary results becomes nearly seamless. Quality checks run in real time, and preliminary analyses are available as soon as data collection ends.

## Building Your AI-Powered Research Stack

Not every tool is worth adopting. The following framework helps prioritize:

<MetricGrid>
  <Metric value="High" label="Priority: Data processing AI" />
  <Metric value="High" label="Priority: Statistical copilots" />
  <Metric value="Medium" label="Priority: Writing assistants" />
  <Metric value="Varies" label="Priority: Experiment platforms" />
</MetricGrid>

### For PhD Students Starting a Dissertation

Start with an AI copilot for your primary statistical language. This delivers immediate time savings with minimal learning curve. Add AI data processing tools when you face your first large merge or cleaning task. Adopt AI writing tools when you begin drafting chapters.

### For Established Researchers Running a Lab

Evaluate AI experiment platforms if your lab runs behavioral studies. The time savings on implementation justify the switching cost. For data-intensive labs, invest in AI data processing infrastructure that produces documented, replicable pipelines. Train research assistants on AI tools rather than having them learn everything from scratch.

### For Applied Researchers and Policy Economists

Prioritize AI tools for data collection and processing, where the highest volume of repetitive work occurs. AI-powered web scraping and administrative data processing can transform projects that were previously infeasible due to data preparation costs.

## The Replication Imperative

One underappreciated benefit of AI-powered research tools is their potential to improve replication rates. When AI generates data processing code, it simultaneously generates documentation. When AI runs analyses, it logs every specification tested, not just the one reported. This creates a natural audit trail that traditional workflows lack.

<KeyTakeaway title="AI Tools and Research Integrity">
The economics profession's replication crisis is partly a tooling problem. Manual data processing is poorly documented, ad hoc, and difficult to reproduce. AI tools that enforce documentation and logging as default behaviors make replication a byproduct of the research process rather than an afterthought.
</KeyTakeaway>

## What to Watch in 2026-2027

Several developments will reshape the toolkit over the next 12-18 months:

**Multimodal data processing.** AI tools that can ingest not just tabular data but PDFs, scanned documents, images of hand-written records, and audio transcripts will expand the frontier of digitizable data.

**Agentic research workflows.** Systems that can execute multi-step research tasks autonomously -- "download CPI data for all OECD countries from 2000-2024, merge with labor force statistics, and run a panel regression with country and year fixed effects" -- are moving from prototype to production.

**Discipline-specific fine-tuning.** General-purpose AI tools work well enough, but economics-specific models that understand Stata syntax, econometric assumptions, and publication norms will deliver meaningfully better results.

**Collaborative AI environments.** Platforms that allow entire research teams to share AI-generated code, data pipelines, and analysis templates will reduce duplication across labs and accelerate cumulative knowledge building.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQAccordion items={[
  {
    question: "Which AI coding copilot works best with Stata?",
    answer: "As of early 2026, the major AI copilots all support Stata syntax, though the depth of econometric understanding varies. Look for copilots that understand Stata-specific conventions like factor variable notation (i.prefix), estimation post-commands (margins, lincom), and output formatting (esttab). Test any copilot on your actual workflow before committing."
  },
  {
    question: "Can AI tools replace a research assistant for data cleaning?",
    answer: "AI tools can handle 60-80% of routine data cleaning tasks -- standardizing formats, detecting outliers, resolving encoding issues, and merging datasets. However, they cannot replace domain judgment about which observations to drop, how to handle missing data in context-specific ways, or whether a data anomaly reflects a real phenomenon. The optimal approach is AI tools supervised by a knowledgeable researcher or RA."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I ensure AI-generated analysis code is correct?",
    answer: "Three practices help: (1) Always review generated code line by line before running it. (2) Validate outputs against known results -- run the AI-generated code on a subset where you know the answer. (3) Use the AI to generate robustness checks that test the same hypothesis through alternative specifications. If results diverge across specifications, investigate before reporting."
  },
  {
    question: "Are AI writing tools appropriate for academic papers?",
    answer: "AI writing assistants are appropriate for proofreading, formatting, and improving clarity. They should not generate substantive claims, theoretical arguments, or interpretation of results. Most journals now have policies on AI use in writing -- check the target journal's policy and disclose AI assistance as required. The standard is that AI assists the writing process; it does not replace the author's intellectual contribution."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the learning curve for adopting AI research tools?",
    answer: "Most AI copilots and writing tools require less than a day to become productive. Data processing and experiment platforms typically require 1-2 weeks of learning to use effectively. The investment pays off quickly: researchers report 30-50% time savings within the first month of adoption for data-intensive tasks."
