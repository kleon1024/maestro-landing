  - question: "When does the EU AI Act take effect?"
    answer: "The EU AI Act entered into force on August 1, 2024, with obligations rolling out in phases. Prohibited AI practice bans took effect February 2, 2025. GPAI model rules became applicable August 2, 2025. The bulk of high-risk AI system compliance requirements take effect August 2, 2026. Full enforcement including penalties applies from that date."
  - question: "What are the penalties under the EU AI Act?"
    answer: "Penalties scale up to 35 million EUR or 7% of global annual turnover (whichever is higher) for prohibited AI practice violations. High-risk system non-compliance penalties reach 15 million EUR or 3% of turnover. Providing incorrect information to authorities carries fines up to 7.5 million EUR or 1% of turnover."
  - question: "Does the EU AI Act apply to companies outside Europe?"
    answer: "Yes. The Act applies to any organization placing AI systems on the EU market or whose AI system outputs are used within the EU, regardless of where the company is headquartered. This extraterritorial scope means US, Asian, and other non-EU companies serving European customers must comply."

The EU AI Act is no longer a distant regulatory threat. It is live, enforceable, and carrying penalties that scale to 7% of global turnover. With the most consequential compliance deadline arriving on August 2, 2026, every company building, deploying, or using AI systems in the European market needs a concrete plan -- not a vague awareness that "something is coming."

This guide breaks down what the Act requires, who it affects, and what your organization must do before enforcement begins.

## Why This Matters Now

The EU AI Act entered into force on August 1, 2024, but its obligations roll out in phases. The first bans on prohibited AI practices took effect on February 2, 2025. Rules for general-purpose AI (GPAI) models became applicable on August 2, 2025. The bulk of remaining obligations -- including the full compliance framework for high-risk AI systems -- takes effect on August 2, 2026.

This phased approach was designed to give organizations time to prepare. That time is running out.

</MetricGrid>

## The Risk Classification System

The Act organizes AI systems into four risk tiers. Your compliance obligations depend entirely on where your systems fall in this hierarchy.

### Tier 1: Unacceptable Risk (Banned)

These AI practices are prohibited outright. No conformity assessment, no mitigation plan -- they simply cannot exist in the EU market.

- Social scoring systems by governments that evaluate citizens based on behavior or personality
- Real-time remote biometric identification in public spaces for law enforcement (with narrow exceptions)
- AI systems that exploit vulnerabilities of specific groups (age, disability, social situation)
- Subliminal manipulation techniques that distort behavior and cause harm
- Emotion recognition in workplaces and educational institutions (with limited exceptions)
- Untargeted scraping of facial images from the internet or CCTV to build facial recognition databases

These prohibitions have been enforceable since February 2, 2025.

### Tier 2: High-Risk (Heavy Regulation)

This is where most compliance work concentrates. High-risk AI systems must meet rigorous requirements before they can be placed on the EU market.

High-risk categories under Annex III include:

| Domain | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| Biometrics | Remote identification, emotion recognition (where permitted) |
| Critical infrastructure | AI managing electricity, gas, water, transport systems |
| Education | Automated grading, admission decisions, learning assessment |
| Employment | CV screening, interview evaluation, promotion decisions |
| Essential services | Credit scoring, insurance risk assessment, emergency dispatch |
| Law enforcement | Predictive policing, evidence evaluation, risk assessment |
| Migration | Asylum application processing, border surveillance |
| Democratic processes | AI influencing voting behavior, electoral outcomes |

### Tier 3: Limited Risk (Transparency Only)

Systems like chatbots, deepfake generators, and AI-generated content must disclose their AI nature to users. The core obligation is transparency: people must know when they are interacting with AI or consuming AI-generated content.

### Tier 4: Minimal Risk (Unregulated)

The majority of AI applications -- spam filters, AI-enhanced video games, inventory management systems -- fall here. No specific obligations beyond existing law.

<Callout type="warning" title="Classification Is Not Optional">
Organizations must proactively classify every AI system they develop or deploy. There is no "wait and see" option. If a regulator determines that your unclassified system is high-risk, you face penalties for non-compliance from the date enforcement began -- not from the date you were notified.
</Callout>

## What High-Risk Compliance Actually Requires

If your AI system falls into the high-risk category, here is what you must have in place by August 2, 2026:

<StepGuide>
  <Step number={1} title="Risk Management System">Implement a continuous risk management process that identifies, analyzes, evaluates, and mitigates risks throughout the AI system's lifecycle. This is not a one-time assessment -- it must be maintained and updated.</Step>
  <Step number={2} title="Data Governance">Establish data governance practices for training, validation, and testing datasets. Ensure datasets are relevant, representative, free of errors, and complete. Document data provenance and processing decisions.</Step>
  <Step number={3} title="Technical Documentation">Maintain comprehensive technical documentation that enables authorities to assess compliance. This includes system architecture, design specifications, development methodology, and validation results.</Step>
  <Step number={4} title="Record-Keeping and Logging">Implement automatic logging capabilities that trace the AI system's operation throughout its lifecycle. Logs must be retained for a period appropriate to the system's intended purpose.</Step>
  <Step number={5} title="Transparency and User Information">Provide clear, adequate information to deployers about the system's capabilities, limitations, intended purpose, and level of accuracy. Include instructions for human oversight.</Step>
  <Step number={6} title="Human Oversight Measures">Design systems to allow effective human oversight during use, including the ability to intervene, override, or shut down the system. Humans must be able to understand the system's outputs.</Step>
  <Step number={7} title="Accuracy, Robustness, and Security">Achieve and maintain appropriate levels of accuracy, robustness, and cybersecurity throughout the system's lifecycle. Document performance metrics and known limitations.</Step>
  <Step number={8} title="Conformity Assessment">Complete the appropriate conformity assessment procedure before placing the system on the market. For most Annex III systems, this is a self-assessment. For biometric systems, a third-party assessment is required.</Step>
</StepGuide>

## The GPAI Rules (Already in Effect)

Since August 2, 2025, providers of general-purpose AI models must comply with a separate set of requirements:

- Maintain and make available technical documentation of the model
- Provide information and documentation to downstream providers integrating the model into their systems
- Establish a policy to comply with EU copyright law
- Publish a sufficiently detailed summary of the training data content

Models classified as posing "systemic risk" (generally those trained with compute exceeding 10^25 FLOPs) face additional obligations: adversarial testing, incident monitoring and reporting, cybersecurity protections, and energy consumption reporting.

Both Google and Microsoft have signed the EU's General-Purpose AI Code of Practice. Microsoft stated it aims to "further build trust in Microsoft AI models, support the European AI ecosystem, and demonstrate our long-standing compliance with EU law." Google Cloud has published detailed guidance on implementing GPAI compliance within cloud infrastructure.

## Penalty Structure

The fines are designed to be meaningful even for the largest technology companies:

| Violation Type | Maximum Fine | Revenue Alternative |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Prohibited AI practices | 35 million EUR | 7% of global annual turnover |
| High-risk system non-compliance | 15 million EUR | 3% of global annual turnover |
| Incorrect information to authorities | 7.5 million EUR | 1.5% of global annual turnover |

For context on the revenue-based penalties: based on 2024 financials, 7% of global revenue would cost Meta approximately 8.5 billion EUR, Google 14 billion EUR, and Microsoft 16 billion EUR.

<KeyTakeaway title="Penalties Scale With Revenue">
The revenue-based alternative ensures that fines remain proportionate and deterrent regardless of company size. A startup faces a 35 million EUR cap. A hyperscaler faces potential penalties in the billions. The Act applies the higher of the two figures.
</KeyTakeaway>

## Extraterritorial Scope: It Applies to You

The EU AI Act has GDPR-style extraterritorial reach. It applies to:

- Any provider placing an AI system on the EU market, regardless of where the provider is established
- Any deployer of AI systems located within the EU
- Providers and deployers located outside the EU, where the output produced by their AI system is used in the EU

Non-EU providers must appoint an authorized representative established in the EU before placing their systems on the market.

This means a US-based company whose AI hiring tool is used by a European subsidiary must comply. A Chinese company whose AI model generates outputs consumed by EU users must comply. Geography is irrelevant; market access determines jurisdiction.

Several US tech companies, including Meta and Apple, have reportedly declined to launch certain AI products in the EU, citing "the unpredictable nature of the European regulatory environment." This avoidance strategy works only if you are willing to forfeit a 450-million-person market.

## Global Regulatory Comparison

The EU AI Act does not exist in isolation. Understanding how it compares to other frameworks helps multinational companies plan compliance strategies:

| Dimension | EU AI Act | US Approach | China AI Rules |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Structure | Horizontal, risk-based | Sector-specific, agency-led | Vertical, technology-specific |
| Scope | All AI systems in EU market | Varies by sector and state | Domestic focus, narrower extraterritorial |
| Enforcement | Centralized penalties up to 7% turnover | Agency-specific enforcement | Administrative penalties, licensing |
| Focus | Ethics, transparency, fundamental rights | Innovation, national security | National security, economic development |
| Extraterritorial | Explicit, broad | Generally absent | Narrower scope |

The EU's approach is the most comprehensive and prescriptive. Companies that achieve EU AI Act compliance will likely satisfy most requirements under other jurisdictions, making it a practical baseline for global compliance programs.

## Sector-Specific Impact

### Healthcare AI

Medical AI systems -- diagnostic tools, treatment recommendation engines, patient risk stratification -- are classified as high-risk under the Act. These systems also fall under existing medical device regulations (MDR/IVDR), creating dual compliance requirements. The conformity assessment for healthcare AI may require third-party evaluation.

### Employment and HR Tech

AI systems used in recruitment (CV screening, automated interviews), performance evaluation, promotion decisions, and workforce monitoring are explicitly high-risk. Organizations using AI hiring tools must ensure transparency about how decisions are made and provide mechanisms for human review of automated decisions.

### Financial Services

Credit scoring, insurance underwriting, and fraud detection AI fall under high-risk classification. Financial institutions must document how their AI models make decisions, maintain audit trails, and ensure that automated decisions can be explained to affected individuals.

### Law Enforcement

Predictive policing tools, evidence analysis systems, and risk assessment instruments used by law enforcement are high-risk with additional scrutiny. Real-time biometric identification in public spaces is prohibited except in narrowly defined circumstances involving serious crime or imminent threats.

## The Digital Omnibus Proposal

In late 2025, the European Commission proposed a "Digital Omnibus" package that may adjust implementation timelines. Under this proposal, the start date for high-risk AI obligations would be linked to the availability of compliance support tools, potentially extending the Annex III deadline to no later than December 2, 2027, and product-embedded AI rules to August 2, 2028.

However, organizations should not rely on this extension. The proposal is not finalized, and building compliance infrastructure takes time regardless of exact deadlines.

<Callout type="info" title="Start Now, Not Later">
Even if the Digital Omnibus extends certain deadlines, the foundational work -- AI system inventory, risk classification, data governance frameworks, documentation practices -- remains necessary and time-consuming. Starting now means avoiding a crisis-mode scramble later.
</Callout>

## Six Steps to Take Before August 2026

<StepGuide>
  <Step number={1} title="Inventory All AI Systems">Catalog every AI system your organization develops, deploys, or uses. Include third-party AI tools purchased from vendors. You cannot classify risk without knowing what you have.</Step>
  <Step number={2} title="Classify Each System by Risk Tier">Apply the Act's classification criteria to each inventoried system. When classification is ambiguous, consult the EU AI Office guidance or seek legal counsel. Err on the side of higher classification.</Step>
  <Step number={3} title="Gap Analysis Against Requirements">For each high-risk system, assess current compliance against the eight requirement areas (risk management, data governance, documentation, logging, transparency, human oversight, accuracy, conformity). Identify gaps.</Step>
  <Step number={4} title="Establish Governance Structure">Designate an AI compliance function with clear authority, budget, and reporting lines. This may sit within legal, risk, or a dedicated AI governance team. Ensure board-level visibility.</Step>
  <Step number={5} title="Implement Technical Controls">Deploy the technical infrastructure needed for compliance: logging systems, documentation tools, monitoring dashboards, human oversight interfaces, and audit trails.</Step>
  <Step number={6} title="Train Your Organization">The AI Act requires AI literacy for all staff involved in AI operations. Develop training programs tailored to different roles: developers, deployers, decision-makers, and compliance staff.</Step>
</StepGuide>

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQAccordion items={[
  {
    question: "Does the EU AI Act apply to companies outside the EU?",
    answer: "Yes. The Act has extraterritorial scope similar to GDPR. It applies to any provider placing AI systems on the EU market and any provider or deployer outside the EU whose AI system outputs are used within the EU. Non-EU companies must appoint an authorized representative in the EU."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between a provider and a deployer under the Act?",
    answer: "A provider develops or places an AI system on the market under its own name or trademark. A deployer uses an AI system under its authority, except for personal non-professional use. Both have obligations, but providers bear the primary compliance burden for high-risk systems, including conformity assessments and technical documentation."
  },
  {
    question: "Can open-source AI models be exempt from the Act?",
    answer: "Open-source models receive limited exemptions. Free and open-source AI models are generally exempt from most provider obligations unless they are high-risk systems or GPAI models with systemic risk. However, the prohibition on unacceptable-risk practices and transparency requirements still apply regardless of licensing model."
  },
  {
    question: "How does the AI Act interact with GDPR?",
    answer: "The two regulations are complementary. GDPR governs personal data processing, while the AI Act governs AI system behavior and risk. An AI system processing personal data must comply with both. Data governance requirements under the AI Act align with but do not replace GDPR obligations. Organizations should integrate compliance efforts rather than treating them as separate workstreams."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if I cannot complete compliance by August 2, 2026?",
    answer: "Non-compliant high-risk AI systems cannot legally be placed on the EU market or used within the EU after the deadline. Enforcement authorities can impose fines up to 15 million EUR or 3% of global turnover. The Digital Omnibus proposal may extend certain deadlines, but this is not finalized. Organizations should plan for the current deadline while monitoring legislative developments."
