  - question: "What AI grants are available for Singapore SMEs in 2026?"
    answer: "Key grants include the Productivity Solutions Grant (PSG) covering up to 50% of AI solution costs, the Enterprise Development Grant (EDG) for custom AI projects, the Enterprise Innovation Scheme (EIS) offering 400% tax deduction on AI spending up to SGD 50,000, and the SMEs Go Digital programme providing sector-specific AI adoption roadmaps."
  - question: "How much funding can an SME get for AI adoption in Singapore?"
    answer: "Funding varies by programme. PSG covers up to 50% of qualifying costs for pre-approved solutions. EDG can fund up to 50% of qualifying project costs (up to 70% for particularly impactful projects). The EIS provides tax deductions rather than direct grants, saving up to SGD 34,000 per year. Multiple programmes can be combined for a single AI transformation initiative."
  - question: "Does my SME need to comply with AI Verify to receive government grants?"
    answer: "AI Verify compliance is not currently a mandatory requirement for most grant programmes. However, IMDA strongly encourages adoption, and companies that demonstrate responsible AI practices through AI Verify may receive preferential consideration in certain programmes. As AI governance expectations tighten, early adoption positions your business ahead of potential future requirements."
  - question: "What qualifies as AI spending under the Enterprise Innovation Scheme?"
    answer: "Qualifying expenditures include AI software licensing and subscriptions, AI development and integration services, AI-related training and certification, cloud computing costs for AI workloads, and consulting fees for AI strategy and implementation.

Singapore has positioned itself as Southeast Asia's AI hub, and the 2026 budget cycle reflects an unprecedented commitment to helping small and medium enterprises adopt artificial intelligence. For SME owners and decision-makers, the challenge is not whether AI incentives exist -- it is navigating the overlapping landscape of grants, tax schemes, and support programmes to find the right fit.

This guide maps every major AI incentive available to Singapore SMEs in 2026, with practical guidance on eligibility, application processes, and how to combine multiple programmes for maximum benefit.

## The AI Incentive Landscape for Singapore SMEs

Singapore's approach to SME AI adoption operates through multiple agencies, each with distinct programmes. Understanding which agency and programme applies to your situation is the first step.

## Productivity Solutions Grant (PSG): Pre-Approved AI Solutions

### What It Covers

The PSG provides direct funding support for SMEs adopting pre-approved technology solutions, including AI-powered tools. Budget 2026 expanded the list of approved AI solutions across multiple sectors.

The grant covers up to 50% of qualifying costs, which includes software licensing, implementation, and initial training. The remaining cost is borne by the business.

### Eligibility Requirements

Your business must meet all of these criteria:

- Registered and operating in Singapore
- At least 30% local shareholding
- Group annual sales turnover below SGD 100 million, or group employment below 200 workers
- The solution must be from the pre-approved vendor list maintained by IMDA

### How to Apply

<StepGuide>
  <Step number={1} title="Check the Pre-Approved Solutions List">Visit the GoBusiness portal to browse AI solutions approved under PSG. Solutions are categorized by sector and function. If the solution you want is not on the list, consider EDG instead.</Step>
  <Step number={2} title="Get Vendor Quotes">Contact approved vendors for quotations. Ensure the quote clearly separates qualifying and non-qualifying costs. Vendors experienced with PSG will know the documentation requirements.</Step>
  <Step number={3} title="Submit Application on Business Grants Portal">Apply through the Business Grants Portal (BGP) with your ACRA business profile, vendor quote, and supporting documents. Processing typically takes 4-6 weeks.</Step>
  <Step number={4} title="Implement and Claim">After approval, implement the solution within the stipulated timeline. Submit claims with proof of payment and implementation documentation to receive the grant disbursement.</Step>
</StepGuide>

### What AI Solutions Are Pre-Approved?

The PSG-approved list includes AI solutions across key categories:

- **Customer relationship management**: AI-powered CRM with automated lead scoring and customer segmentation
- **Accounting and finance**: AI-assisted bookkeeping, invoice processing, and financial forecasting
- **Human resources**: AI recruitment screening, employee engagement analytics
- **Operations**: Predictive maintenance, inventory optimization, quality control
- **Marketing**: AI content generation, customer behavior analytics, personalization engines

## Enterprise Development Grant (EDG): Custom AI Projects

### When to Use EDG Instead of PSG

The EDG is the right choice when your AI needs go beyond pre-approved solutions. If you need a custom AI system -- such as a proprietary recommendation engine, a sector-specific predictive model, or an AI integration with existing enterprise systems -- EDG provides funding for bespoke development.

### Funding Structure

EDG supports up to 50% of qualifying project costs, with enhanced support of up to 70% for projects with significant business impact or innovation potential. Qualifying costs include:

- External consultancy and development services
- Software and equipment for the AI project
- Internal manpower costs (capped at defined rates)
- Training directly related to the project

### Application Process

EDG applications are evaluated on a project basis, considering the potential business impact, feasibility, and the company's capacity to implement. Applications go through the Business Grants Portal and require a detailed project proposal.

The evaluation period is typically 8-12 weeks, longer than PSG due to the custom nature of each proposal. Start early and consider engaging an experienced grant consultant if your team is unfamiliar with the process.

## Enterprise Innovation Scheme (EIS): Tax Deductions on AI Spending

The EIS provides a different type of incentive -- tax deductions rather than direct grants. For businesses already spending on AI, this can be the most accessible incentive because it does not require pre-approval of specific solutions.

### How It Works

Under the [EIS AI expansion announced in Budget 2026](/blog/singapore-budget-2026-ai-guide-eis-psg-champions), businesses can claim a 400% tax deduction on qualifying AI expenditures, up to SGD 50,000 per Year of Assessment.

**Worked example**: SGD 50,000 in qualifying AI spending generates SGD 200,000 in tax deductions. At the 17% corporate tax rate, this saves SGD 34,000 -- recovering 68% of the original investment through tax relief.

### Qualifying Expenditures

- AI software subscriptions and licensing fees
- AI development and integration services from external providers
- Cloud computing costs for AI workloads (AWS, GCP, Azure AI services)
- AI training and certification for employees
- AI consulting and strategy services

### How to Claim

Unlike PSG and EDG, the EIS does not require a separate application. You claim the enhanced deduction when filing your corporate tax return. The key requirement is maintaining clear documentation linking expenditures to AI activities.

## IMDA AI Verify Framework: Governance and Compliance

### Why It Matters for Grant Applications

The [AI Verify framework](/blog/imda-ai-verify-framework-guide) is Singapore's national framework for responsible AI governance. While not currently mandatory for most grant programmes, demonstrating AI Verify compliance signals maturity and responsibility -- factors that can strengthen EDG applications and position your business for future regulatory requirements.

### What AI Verify Covers

AI Verify provides a testing framework and software toolkit that helps organizations assess their AI systems against internationally recognized principles:

- **Transparency**: Can you explain how your AI system makes decisions?
- **Fairness**: Does your AI system treat different demographic groups equitably?
- **Safety and robustness**: How does your system handle adversarial inputs or edge cases?
- **Accountability**: Who is responsible when the AI system makes errors?

### Implementation for SMEs

For most SMEs, full AI Verify implementation is proportional to the complexity of your AI deployment. A small business using AI-powered CRM does not need the same governance rigor as a financial services firm deploying credit scoring models. IMDA provides tiered guidance appropriate to different risk levels and business sizes.

## Combining Multiple Programmes

One of the most effective strategies is combining complementary incentive programmes. This is explicitly permitted and encouraged by Singapore government agencies.

### Example: Combined Approach for a Manufacturing SME

| Programme | Use Case | Estimated Benefit |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| PSG | Adopt pre-approved AI quality control solution | SGD 15,000 grant (50% of SGD 30,000 solution) |
| EDG | Develop custom predictive maintenance model | SGD 50,000 grant (50% of SGD 100,000 project) |
| EIS | Deduct AI cloud computing and subscription costs | SGD 17,000 tax savings on SGD 50,000 AI OpEx |
| SkillsFuture | Train 5 staff on AI operations | SGD 10,000 in training subsidies |
| **Total** | | **SGD 92,000 in combined incentives** |

<KeyTakeaway title="Stack Your Incentives">
Singapore's AI incentive programmes are designed to complement each other. A single AI transformation initiative can often qualify for direct grants (PSG/EDG), tax deductions (EIS), and training subsidies (SkillsFuture) simultaneously. Map your full AI investment plan before applying to maximize total support.
</KeyTakeaway>

## Practical Steps: Getting Started

### Step 1: Assess Your AI Readiness

Before applying for any grant, understand where AI can create the most value in your business. IMDA's free digital readiness assessment and SMEs Go Digital advisory services are designed for this purpose.

### Step 2: Map Incentives to Your Plan

Match each component of your AI adoption plan to the most appropriate incentive programme. Use PSG for standard solutions, EDG for custom development, EIS for ongoing costs, and SkillsFuture for training.

### Step 3: Engage the Right Partners

For PSG, work with pre-approved vendors who understand the grant process. For EDG, consider engaging a development partner experienced with Singapore government grants -- they can help structure proposals that align with evaluation criteria.

### Step 4: Document Everything

All incentive programmes require documentation proving that funds were used for their intended purpose. Maintain clear records of:

- Vendor contracts and invoices
- Implementation timelines and milestones
- Business impact metrics before and after AI adoption
- Training attendance and certification records

## The Bigger Picture: Singapore's National AI Strategy

The incentive programmes for SMEs exist within Singapore's broader [National AI Strategy](/blog/singapore-national-ai-council-enterprise-ai-adoption), which includes four National AI Missions, the AI Park at One-North, and the Champions of AI programme for larger enterprises. Understanding this context helps SMEs position themselves within the growing AI ecosystem and identify partnership opportunities with larger organizations.

Singapore's goal is not just individual company AI adoption -- it is building a national AI-capable workforce and economy. SMEs that adopt AI early gain both the direct operational benefits and the strategic advantage of being part of this transformation.
