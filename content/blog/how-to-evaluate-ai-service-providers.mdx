faq:
  - question: "What criteria should I use to evaluate AI service providers?"
    answer: "Evaluate across five dimensions: (1) Technical capability -- relevant domain experience, model selection rationale, and deployment track record; (2) Data handling -- security practices, compliance certifications, and data governance policies; (3) Deliverable quality -- code standards, documentation, testing practices, and maintainability; (4) Commercial terms -- pricing transparency, IP ownership, SLA commitments, and exit provisions; (5) Team and process -- team composition, communication practices, project methodology, and escalation procedures."
  - question: "What are the red flags when evaluating AI vendors?"
    answer: "Major red flags include: guaranteed accuracy percentages without seeing your data, inability to explain their technical approach in clear terms, no references from comparable projects, unclear IP ownership terms, resistance to pilot projects or proof-of-concept phases, vendor lock-in through proprietary formats or platforms, and pricing that seems significantly below market rates (often indicating hidden costs or scope limitations)."
  - question: "Should I choose a large AI consultancy or a specialized boutique provider?"
    answer: "It depends on your needs. Large consultancies (Accenture, Deloitte, McKinsey Digital) offer broad capabilities, established processes, and risk mitigation but at premium pricing with potential staffing variability. Specialized boutique providers offer deeper domain expertise, senior team involvement, and typically lower costs but may have capacity constraints. For well-defined projects under $500K, specialized providers often deliver better value. For large-scale enterprise transformations, larger firms provide program management capabilities."
  - question: "How should AI service provider pricing work?"
    answer: "Common models include: fixed-price (best for well-defined scope), time-and-materials (best for exploratory or evolving projects), retainer (best for ongoing AI operations), and outcome-based (where the provider shares risk and reward). Avoid pure time-and-materials for production deployments -- it creates misaligned incentives. The best approach for most projects is a hybrid: fixed-price for defined deliverables with time-and-materials for discovery and iteration phases."
  - question: "What should an AI services RFP include?"
    answer: "A strong RFP includes: business context and objectives, specific technical requirements and constraints, data description (volume, format, sensitivity), success criteria with measurable KPIs, timeline and milestone expectations, budget range (omitting this wastes everyone's time), evaluation criteria and weighting, required certifications or compliance standards, and IP ownership terms. Include a section asking vendors to describe their approach, not just capabilities."

Choosing the wrong AI service provider is one of the most expensive mistakes a business can make. Unlike traditional IT services where a bad vendor delivers a subpar but functional product, a bad AI vendor can deliver a system that looks impressive in demos but fails catastrophically in production -- wasting months of time, hundreds of thousands of dollars, and organizational credibility for future AI investments.

This guide provides a structured evaluation framework based on real procurement experiences across enterprise AI projects. It is written for procurement leads, CTOs, and business leaders responsible for selecting AI implementation partners.

## The AI Vendor Landscape in 2026

The AI services market has fragmented into distinct categories, each with different strengths and trade-offs.

| Freelance/contractor | Individual ML engineers | Specific technical tasks, augmentation | $80-200/hr |
| Academic partnerships | University research labs | Cutting-edge research, novel approaches | Variable |

## The Five-Dimension Evaluation Framework

### Dimension 1: Technical Capability

This is where most evaluations start, and rightfully so. But "technical capability" is broader than model accuracy.

**Domain experience**: Has the provider delivered AI solutions in your industry? An AI provider experienced in retail recommendation engines may not be the right choice for healthcare diagnostic AI, even if the underlying ML techniques are similar. Domain knowledge determines whether the provider understands your data, your constraints, and your definition of success.

**Technology stack**: What frameworks, platforms, and infrastructure does the provider use? Are they wedded to a single platform (potential lock-in) or flexible across environments? Do they have experience with your existing technology stack?

**Deployment track record**: Building AI models in notebooks is fundamentally different from deploying them in production. Ask specifically about production deployments: How many? What scale? What uptime? What monitoring and maintenance approach?

**Research vs. engineering balance**: Some providers excel at research (novel models, state-of-the-art accuracy) but struggle with engineering (reliability, scalability, monitoring). For production deployments, engineering discipline matters more than model novelty.

<Callout type="info" title="Ask for Production References">
Any provider can show you a demo. Ask for references from clients who have been running the provider's AI system in production for at least 6 months. Production experience reveals integration quality, maintenance practices, and how the provider handles issues that only surface at scale.
</Callout>

### Dimension 2: Data Handling and Security

AI projects are data projects. The provider's data handling practices directly affect your risk exposure.

**Data security**: What certifications does the provider hold (SOC 2, ISO 27001)? Where will your data be stored and processed? Who has access? What happens to your data after the project ends?

**Compliance**: Does the provider understand the regulatory requirements in your industry? For [Singapore businesses](/blog/singapore-budget-2026-ai-sme), does the provider align with the [IMDA AI Verify framework](/blog/imda-ai-verify-framework-guide)?

**Data governance**: How does the provider handle data quality issues? What documentation do they produce about data lineage, transformations, and cleaning decisions? This is especially critical for [research data services](/blog/how-to-choose-ai-research-data-service) where reproducibility is paramount.

### Dimension 3: Deliverable Quality

Request sample deliverables from previous (anonymized) projects. Evaluate:

**Code quality**: Is the code well-structured, documented, and maintainable? Can your internal team understand and modify it? AI code that only the original developer can maintain is a liability, not an asset.

**Documentation**: Does the provider deliver comprehensive documentation including architecture decisions, data processing steps, model selection rationale, and operational runbooks? Documentation is a leading indicator of project maturity.

**Testing**: What testing practices does the provider follow? Unit tests, integration tests, model validation, and performance benchmarks should all be standard deliverables.

**Reproducibility**: Can you reproduce the provider's results independently? For AI systems, this means documented model training, versioned datasets, and reproducible pipelines.

### Dimension 4: Commercial Terms

Commercial terms can make or break an AI engagement, even when the technical delivery is strong.

**Pricing model**: Understand exactly what you are paying for. Common models:

| Model | When to Use | Risk Profile |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Fixed-price | Well-defined scope, clear deliverables | Provider bears scope risk |
| Time-and-materials | Exploratory work, evolving requirements | Client bears scope risk |
| Retainer | Ongoing AI operations, maintenance | Predictable cost, potential underutilization |
| Outcome-based | Measurable business KPIs | Shared risk, requires clear metrics |
| Hybrid | Most projects | Balanced risk allocation |

**IP ownership**: Who owns the trained models, the training data, the code, and the pipeline? Standard practice is that the client owns all project-specific deliverables. Be cautious of providers who retain rights to models trained on your data.

**SLA commitments**: For production AI systems, what uptime, response time, and resolution time guarantees does the provider offer? What are the penalties for SLA breaches?

**Exit provisions**: If the relationship ends, how do you transition? Can you operate the system independently? Is the provider contractually obligated to support a transition period?

### Dimension 5: Team and Process

**Team composition**: Who will actually work on your project? Ask for named team members with relevant experience. Beware of the "bait and switch" where senior team members win the deal but junior staff execute the work.

**Communication practices**: How will the provider communicate progress, issues, and decisions? Weekly status reports, sprint demos, and escalation procedures should be defined before the project starts.

**Project methodology**: Agile, waterfall, or hybrid? For AI projects, iterative approaches work best because requirements often evolve as the team learns from the data. But the iteration must be structured, not chaotic.

## Red Flags

### Immediate Disqualifiers

- **Guaranteed accuracy before seeing your data.** No responsible AI provider makes accuracy guarantees without understanding your specific data, domain, and use case. This signals either ignorance or dishonesty.

- **Cannot explain their approach in business terms.** If the provider can only speak in technical jargon and cannot explain how their approach connects to your business outcomes, they either do not understand your problem or cannot communicate effectively. Both are disqualifying.

- **No references from comparable projects.** Every provider was new once, but for significant investments, you need evidence of relevant delivery capability.

- **Unclear IP ownership.** If the provider is evasive about who owns the deliverables, expect a fight later. Clarify ownership in writing before signing.

### Caution Signs

- **Significantly below-market pricing.** This usually means junior staffing, limited scope, or hidden costs that surface later.

- **Proprietary tools with no export capability.** If your AI system can only run on the provider's platform, you are locked in. Ensure you can migrate or operate independently.

- **Resistance to pilot projects.** Good providers welcome pilots because they are confident in their delivery. Providers who push for large commitments without proof of concept may be hiding capability gaps.

- **Overpromising timelines.** AI projects are inherently uncertain. A provider who promises faster delivery than competitors either has a better approach (ask them to explain it) or is being unrealistic.

<KeyTakeaway title="The Reference Check Is Non-Negotiable">
Call at least two client references for any AI provider you are seriously evaluating. Ask specific questions: Was the project delivered on time and budget? How did the provider handle unexpected issues? Would you engage them again? What would you do differently? Reference checks are the single highest-value activity in the evaluation process.
</KeyTakeaway>

## Building Your RFP

A well-structured RFP saves time for both you and the vendors, and produces better proposals.

### Essential RFP Sections

1. **Business context**: What problem are you solving and why now?
2. **Technical requirements**: Data description, integration points, performance requirements
3. **Success criteria**: Measurable KPIs with specific targets
4. **Timeline**: Key milestones and deadlines
5. **Budget range**: Include a range. Omitting budget wastes everyone's time and produces non-comparable proposals
6. **Evaluation criteria**: State how you will evaluate proposals and the relative weighting of each criterion
7. **Required information**: What you need from vendors (team bios, references, approach description, pricing breakdown)
8. **Compliance requirements**: Certifications, regulatory requirements, data handling standards

### Evaluation Scoring Template

| Criterion | Weight | Score (1-5) | Weighted Score |
|-----------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Technical capability and domain experience | 30% | | |
| Data handling and security | 20% | | |
| Deliverable quality (based on samples) | 20% | | |
| Commercial terms and pricing | 15% | | |
| Team composition and process | 15% | | |
| **Total** | **100%** | | |

## The Pilot Phase

Never commit to a full engagement without a pilot. A well-designed pilot:

- **Costs 10-15% of the full project budget**
- **Runs for 4-8 weeks**
- **Tests the most uncertain aspect of the project** (usually data quality or model performance)
- **Produces a clear go/no-go decision** based on predefined success criteria

The pilot is also your best opportunity to evaluate the provider's working style, communication quality, and technical depth. A provider that struggles during the pilot will struggle during the full engagement.
