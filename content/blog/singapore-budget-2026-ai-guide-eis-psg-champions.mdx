Singapore Budget 2026 represents the most significant government commitment to artificial intelligence in the nation's history. With the Prime Minister personally chairing the new National AI Council, the message is clear: AI is no longer a technology initiative -- it is a national strategic priority.

For businesses operating in Singapore, this translates into concrete financial incentives, infrastructure investments, and workforce development programmes. But navigating the landscape of acronyms -- EIS, PSG, Champions of AI -- requires a practical understanding of what each programme offers, who qualifies, and how to claim benefits.

This guide breaks down every AI-related initiative announced in Budget 2026 and provides a clear framework for determining which programmes apply to your business.

## Overview of Budget 2026 AI Initiatives

Before diving into each programme, here is a summary of every AI-related initiative and its primary benefit:

## Enterprise Innovation Scheme (EIS): 400% Tax Deduction

### What It Is

The Enterprise Innovation Scheme provides enhanced tax deductions on qualifying expenditures related to innovation and technology. Under Budget 2026, EIS has been expanded to explicitly include AI expenditures for Years of Assessment (YA) 2027 and 2028.

The headline figure: businesses can claim a 400% tax deduction on qualifying AI spending, up to a cap of SGD 50,000 per Year of Assessment.

### What This Means in Practice

A 400% tax deduction means that for every dollar spent on qualifying AI activities, your business can deduct four dollars from taxable income. At Singapore's corporate tax rate of 17%, this translates to significant savings.

**Worked example:** If your company spends SGD 50,000 on qualifying AI expenditures, the 400% deduction gives you SGD 200,000 in deductions. At 17% corporate tax, the tax saving is approximately SGD 34,000 -- recovering 68% of the original spend through tax relief.

### Who Qualifies

Businesses registered in Singapore with qualifying AI expenditures. The EIS applies across company sizes, though SMEs benefit disproportionately given the cap structure. Qualifying expenditures must relate to AI development, integration, or adoption activities.

### How to Claim

<StepGuide>
  <Step number={1} title="Identify Qualifying Expenditures">Review your AI-related spending for the relevant Year of Assessment. This includes AI software licensing, development costs, integration services, and related training.</Step>
  <Step number={2} title="Document AI Activities">Maintain clear records linking expenditures to specific AI initiatives. IRAS requires documentation showing the nature and purpose of the AI spending.</Step>
  <Step number={3} title="Calculate Deduction">Apply the 400% multiplier to qualifying expenditures, up to the SGD 50,000 cap per YA. The maximum deduction is SGD 200,000 per YA.</Step>
  <Step number={4} title="File with Corporate Tax Return">Claim the enhanced deduction when filing your corporate tax return for YA 2027 or YA 2028. Ensure supporting documentation is retained for audit purposes.</Step>
</StepGuide>

<Callout type="info" title="Timing Matters">
The AI expansion applies to YA 2027 and YA 2028 only. This means the qualifying expenditure must fall within the financial year ending in 2026 or 2027, depending on your company's financial year-end. Plan your AI investments accordingly to maximize the benefit window.
</Callout>

## Productivity Solutions Grant (PSG): Direct Funding for AI Adoption

### What It Is

The Productivity Solutions Grant provides direct funding support to businesses adopting technology solutions, including AI-enabled tools and platforms. Budget 2026 expanded PSG to cover a broader range of digital and AI-enabled solutions.

Unlike EIS, which reduces your tax bill, PSG provides upfront co-funding that directly offsets the cost of adopting AI solutions.

### Who Qualifies

PSG is targeted at SMEs. Typical eligibility criteria include:

- Registered and operating in Singapore
- Purchase or subscription of qualifying IT solutions and equipment
- Minimum 30% local shareholding (for different grant tiers)
- Group annual revenue below SGD 100 million or group employment size of fewer than 200 employees

### What It Covers

Under the expanded scope, PSG now covers a broader range of AI-enabled solutions including:

- AI-powered business management tools
- Automated customer service and engagement platforms
- AI-driven data analytics and business intelligence solutions
- Digital workflow automation with AI components
- Industry-specific AI solutions (accounting, legal, logistics, etc.)

### How to Apply

<StepGuide>
  <Step number={1} title="Identify Your Needs">Determine which business processes would benefit most from AI-enabled solutions. Common starting points include customer service, data analysis, and document processing.</Step>
  <Step number={2} title="Select a Pre-Approved Solution">Browse the list of PSG pre-approved solutions on the Business Grants Portal. Solutions are categorized by industry and function.</Step>
  <Step number={3} title="Obtain Vendor Quotation">Get a formal quotation from the solution vendor. Ensure the quotation aligns with the pre-approved solution package.</Step>
  <Step number={4} title="Submit Application via Business Grants Portal">Apply through the Business Grants Portal (BGP) at businessgrants.gov.sg. Include the vendor quotation and supporting documents.</Step>
  <Step number={5} title="Receive Approval and Implement">Once approved, proceed with implementation. Retain all invoices and proof of implementation for claims.</Step>
  <Step number={6} title="Submit Claims">After implementation, submit claims through BGP with supporting documentation to receive the grant disbursement.</Step>
</StepGuide>

## Champions of AI Programme: End-to-End Business Transformation

### What It Is

The Champions of AI Programme is a comprehensive support initiative designed to help firms undertake complete AI business transformation. Unlike point solutions funded by PSG or tax relief through EIS, this programme addresses both enterprise transformation and workforce training as an integrated package.

This is the most ambitious of the three programmes, aimed at firms that want to make AI central to their operations rather than adopting it incrementally.

### What It Covers

The programme provides support across two dimensions:

**Enterprise Transformation:**
- AI strategy development and roadmap planning
- Process re-engineering for AI integration
- Technology infrastructure assessment and upgrading
- Change management support

**Workforce Training:**
- AI skills assessment for existing employees
- Customized training programmes aligned to business transformation goals
- Hands-on workshops and practical implementation exercises
- Ongoing capability building support

### Who It Is For

The Champions of AI Programme is designed for firms that are ready to move beyond pilot projects and make AI a core part of their business operations. This typically means:

- Companies with clear business problems that AI can address
- Leadership commitment to organizational change
- Willingness to invest in both technology and people
- A defined vision for how AI transforms their competitive position

<Callout type="warning" title="Not a Quick Fix">
Champions of AI is not a grant for buying software. It is a programme for comprehensive business transformation. Companies should be prepared for organizational change, not just technology procurement.
</Callout>

## Which Programme Is Right for Your Business?

Determining which programmes apply to your situation depends on your company's size, AI maturity, and objectives. Use this decision framework:

<StepGuide>
  <Step number={1} title="Are You an SME?">If yes, PSG is likely your starting point for direct co-funding of AI tool adoption. You may also qualify for EIS if you have qualifying AI R&D or development expenditures.</Step>
  <Step number={2} title="Do You Have AI Development or Integration Costs?">If you are spending on AI software development, integration, or significant customization, the EIS 400% deduction applies regardless of company size (up to the SGD 50,000 cap).</Step>
  <Step number={3} title="Are You Ready for Organization-Wide AI Transformation?">If your company is prepared for comprehensive change -- not just adopting a tool, but restructuring processes and upskilling teams around AI -- the Champions of AI Programme is designed for you.</Step>
  <Step number={4} title="Can You Stack Multiple Programmes?">In many cases, yes. A company might use PSG to fund initial AI tool adoption, claim EIS deductions on AI development costs, and participate in Champions of AI for broader transformation. Consult with a qualified advisor to understand stacking limitations.</Step>
</StepGuide>

## The Broader AI Ecosystem: Supporting Infrastructure

Beyond the three core programmes, Budget 2026 announced several ecosystem-level investments that create the environment for business AI adoption:

### National AI Council

Chaired by PM Lawrence Wong, the National AI Council provides strategic direction for Singapore's AI development. For businesses, this signals long-term government commitment and policy stability -- factors that reduce the risk of investing in AI capabilities.

### AI Park at One-North

Building on the Lorong AI pilot, the AI Park at One-North will create a physical cluster designed to catalyse AI collaboration between companies, researchers, and startups. For businesses exploring AI partnerships or seeking talent, this concentration of capability creates opportunities for collaboration and recruitment.

### 4 National AI Missions

The four missions -- advanced manufacturing, connectivity, finance, and healthcare -- define priority sectors where government investment and support will be concentrated. Companies operating in these sectors can expect accelerated access to resources, partnerships, and pilot opportunities.

### SkillsFuture AI Pathways

The redesigned SkillsFuture website now features clearer AI learning pathways, making it easier for employees to identify relevant training. Participants in qualifying training courses receive 6 months of free premium AI tools, with initial focus on the accountancy and legal sectors.

<KeyTakeaway title="Stack the Benefits">
The most effective approach is to combine multiple programmes. Use PSG for initial AI tool adoption, claim EIS deductions on qualifying development costs, and pursue Champions of AI for comprehensive transformation. Each programme addresses a different stage of the AI adoption journey, and they are designed to work together.
</KeyTakeaway>

## Working with an AI Partner

Navigating government incentive programmes while simultaneously implementing AI solutions is operationally demanding. Many businesses benefit from working with an AI solutions partner that understands both the technology landscape and the incentive ecosystem.

For businesses evaluating their AI readiness, a structured assessment can identify which programmes offer the highest return on investment for your specific situation. This assessment considers your current technology stack, business processes, workforce capabilities, and strategic objectives to recommend a prioritized programme participation plan.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

<Callout type="warning" title="Documentation Is Everything">
The most common mistake businesses make is failing to maintain adequate documentation linking expenditures to qualifying activities. IRAS requires clear evidence that spending relates to genuine AI development or adoption -- not general IT costs relabeled as AI.
</Callout>

**Confusing EIS with PSG:** EIS is a tax deduction (reduces taxable income); PSG is a grant (direct co-funding). They serve different purposes and have different application processes.

**Missing the window:** The EIS AI expansion covers YA 2027-2028 only. Delaying AI investment until 2029 means missing this enhanced deduction entirely.

**Applying for the wrong programme:** SMEs looking for quick AI wins should start with PSG. Companies attempting comprehensive transformation should look at Champions of AI. EIS benefits companies already spending on AI development.

**Underestimating Champions of AI commitment:** This programme requires genuine organizational change. Companies that treat it as a funding source without committing to transformation will not derive full value.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQAccordion items={[
  {
    question: "Can a company benefit from both EIS and PSG simultaneously?",
    answer: "In principle, yes, as they address different types of expenditure. EIS provides tax deductions on qualifying AI development and integration costs, while PSG co-funds the adoption of pre-approved technology solutions. However, you cannot claim both EIS and PSG on the same expenditure item. Consult with a tax advisor to structure your AI investments for maximum benefit across both programmes."
  },
  {
    question: "What counts as qualifying AI expenditure under EIS?",
    answer: "The expanded EIS covers expenditures related to AI development, integration, and adoption. This includes AI software development costs, AI model training and customization, integration of AI capabilities into existing systems, and related technical consulting. General IT spending that does not involve AI does not qualify. Maintain detailed documentation linking each expenditure to specific AI activities."
  },
  {
    question: "How does the SGD 50,000 cap work for EIS?",
    answer: "The cap applies to qualifying expenditure per Year of Assessment. You can claim up to SGD 50,000 of qualifying AI expenditure at the 400% enhanced deduction rate per YA. Spending above the cap may still qualify for standard deduction rates. The enhanced rate applies for YA 2027 and YA 2028, giving businesses a two-year window to maximize the benefit."
  },
  {
    question: "Is the Champions of AI Programme available to all industries?",
    answer: "The Champions of AI Programme is designed to support firms across industries in comprehensive AI business transformation. However, the initial rollout may prioritize sectors aligned with the 4 National AI Missions: advanced manufacturing, connectivity, finance, and healthcare. Companies in other sectors should monitor announcements for expanded eligibility."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the timeline for PSG applications related to AI solutions?",
    answer: "PSG applications are processed on a rolling basis through the Business Grants Portal. The expanded scope covering AI-enabled solutions takes effect following Budget 2026 implementation. Processing times vary, but businesses should allow several weeks for approval. It is advisable to apply early, as popular solution categories may see high demand."
